    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This privacy policy explains how the Subscription Email Cleaner Chrome extension handles user data.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or process any personal data from users. The extension operates locally on your device and does not transmit any data to external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Email Data</h2>
    <p>The extension only processes email data when you are actively using the Gmail app. Once you close the active tab, any processed email data is discarded and not saved.</p>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension requires certain permissions to function correctly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To store user preferences locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Active Tab:</strong> To access the content of the active tab when you are using the Gmail app.</li>
        <li><strong>Scripting:</strong> To inject scripts into the Gmail app for processing subscription emails.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not use any third-party services to collect or process your data.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page.</p>
